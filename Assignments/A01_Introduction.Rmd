## 1) Discussion Questions

1. What are your previous experiences with data analytics, R, and Git? Include both formal and informal training.

2. Are there any components of the course about which you feel confident?

> Answer: I am comfortable with core statistics concepts. 

3. Are there any components of the course about which you feel apprehensive?

> Answer: I do not have a coding background, so I am hoping I will be able to keep up with the students that do. 


## 2) GitHub
